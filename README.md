Star Formation: Analysis of the Spitzer Mapping of the Outer Galaxy (SMOG) field 

Winston E., Hora, J., Tolls, V., Gutermuth, R., 2019, ApJ, submitted

The SMOG field covers a 21 square degree region of the galactic plane pointed towards the outer galaxy at coordinates:
102 < l < 109, and 0 < b < 3.

The field was mapped with Spitzer's IRAC and MIPS instruments at 3.6, 4.5, 5.8, 8.0 and 24um, with at best ~1.6" resolution. 
These data were combined with 2MASS J, H, Ks over the full field and UKIDSS J, H, Ks over half the field from l ~ 102-105.

YSOs were identified using CCD and CMD selections, and clusters/associations were identified using DBSCAN and minimum spanning tree methods.
